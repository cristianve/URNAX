# 1. Main idea 🤔💭

A company dedicated to electronic voting has been given the green light by the ministry to create and deploy an electronic voting software for the next municipal elections.  

They have asked for a software solution (Scala) that will help them to validate the identity of the voters and of course they can only vote once. The software will also send on day of voting a message to the registered users giving the location of the polling station where they are assigned to vote.



# 2. Requirements ✔️

The requirements for this application are:

* Correct implementation of the object-oriented paradigm, making proper use of the different entities that exist in the language
of the different entities that exist in the language: object, class, case, class, etc.
* The use "whenever possible" of expressions in the code.
* Typical functional programming figures, such as:
  o HOF (Higher Order Functions)
  o Option (tipos nullables)
  o Pattern matching
  o Funciones anónimas
  o Programación asíncrona
  o Comentarios en código
  o Estructura limpia y legibilidad
